The data for Tympa and Octomys each were generated by multiplexing five RNA libraries (liver, heart, muscle, lung, kidney and gonad (testis or ovary) on one lane.  This creates concerns about lane effects, which we will just have to include as a source of noise.

First we used Trimmomatic to trim the reads.
